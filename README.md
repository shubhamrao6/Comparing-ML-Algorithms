# Comparing-ML-Algorithms
I compared three diffrent machine learning algorithms using sklearn for a binary classification problem and compared the results.               
The classification is a simple binary classification which tries to find whether the customer will buy the bike or not.                        
Three classifiers were used namely:
* K Nearest Neighbors Classifier
* Random Forrest Classifier
* Support Vector Machine Classifier
